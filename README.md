# monte-carlo-sampling

Monte Carlo Model to simulate the probabilities of, at least one rare event on a given population.

The Model will evaluate the probabilities on the range provided, and can be customized to different use cases.

These probabilities are adjusted by the probability of the event per se, 
and the probability of an error identifying the event as correct.
